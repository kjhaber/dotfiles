# README - Cursor setup

## keybindings.json

Note: keybindings.json is not automatically picked up by Cursor - it needs to be symlinked to Cursor's config directory under `~/Library/Application Support`:

```
ln -s ~/.cursor/keybindings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/keybindings.json
```
