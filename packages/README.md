# Packages lists

* brew-pkg-list
  Homebrew packages, from `brew leaves`

* brew-cask-list
  Homebrew cask packages, from `brew cask list`

* vim-plugin-list
  List of each vim plugin's (GitHub) master git repository, for cloning into
  ~/.vim/bundle.

* npm-g-list
  NPM globally installed packages, from `npm -g ls --depth 0`.  (Not too many
  of these: most dev tools are project-specific, and a couple are personal toy
  projects/utilities.)
